# Centinela Mine Sensor Prediction

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook project aims to predict sensor failures in the Centinela Mine using a linear regression model.
The model utilizes data processing with Pandas, numerical operations with NumPy, visualization with Matplotlib, 
and machine learning functionality from Scikit-Learn.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-Learn
You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```
